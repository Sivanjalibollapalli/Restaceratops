## API Testing Explained 🚀

### What is an API? 🔌

Think of an **API** like a **messenger** between different computer programs. It's how programs talk to each other! 

### Real-world example 🌍

Imagine you're ordering food through a phone app:

1. **You** (using the app) → **API** → **Restaurant's computer**
2. **Restaurant's computer** → **API** → **You** (showing menu, prices, etc.)

The API is like the waiter who takes your order and brings back your food!

### What is API Testing? 🧪

**API testing** is like checking if the waiter (API) is doing their job correctly:

- ✅ Does the waiter understand your order?
- ✅ Does the waiter bring back the right food?
- ✅ Does the waiter handle mistakes properly?
- ✅ Is the waiter fast enough?

## How Restaceratops Tests APIs 🦖

### 1. **Automatic Test Generation** 🤖

Restaceratops can look at an API and automatically create tests for it!

**Example**: If you have a pizza ordering API, it will automatically test:
- Can you get the menu? ✅
- Can you order a pizza? ✅
- Can you pay for the pizza? ✅
- What happens if you order something that doesn't exist? ❌

### 2. **Different Types of API Tests** 📋

**Positive Tests** ✅
- "Test if ordering a pizza works correctly"
- "Test if getting the menu works"

**Negative Tests** ❌
- "Test what happens if you try to order a pizza with no toppings"
- "Test what happens if you try to pay with fake money"

**Edge Cases** 🎯
- "Test what happens if you order 999 pizzas"
- "Test what happens if you use special characters in your name"

### 3. **Real Examples from Restaceratops** 📝

Here's what a simple API test looks like:

```yaml
- name: "Test getting users"
  request:
    method: GET
    url: https://api.example.com/users
  expect:
    status: 200  # Should work successfully

- name: "Test creating a user"
  request:
    method: POST
    url: https://api.example.com/users
    json:
      name: "John"
      email: "john@example.com"
      password: "secret123"
  expect:
    status: 201  # Should create successfully
```

### 4. **What Restaceratops Tests** 🔍
